# OnlineQuiz

**Introduction**

Build a web page that can deliver quizzes that a student can take and view their scores 
afterwards. An administrator should be able to observe the grades of all students.
The system must contain a set of at least four quizzes divided into two categories, aptitude 
and technical, technical being subdivided into three categories, say, Java, Python, and 
Linux.
Think about the requirements that a training programme similar to the one you’re currently 
undergoing might have: the questions and answers are just one part of the quiz system - it 
needs a way to manage students, administrators; have ways of displaying scores, 
performance, progress…

**Basic operations**

A student must be able to login and navigate to either their Quizzes or their Gradebook. The 
Gradebook must contain descriptive statistics of their performance in each quiz, category, 
and a report of their performance as a whole. The Quizzes section must provide access to 
take a quiz. Each quiz consists of a set number of multiple choice questions. Students must 
be able to navigate between the questions, choose an answer for each question, and submit 
their answers at the end of the quiz. Once submitted, they should have their answers 
evaluated and a screen must be displayed showing their performance.


An administrator must be able to login and navigate to either Students or Quizzes. The 
Students section must contain a list of students to select from, and detailed performance 
information (quiz-wise and collective) must be provided for each student. The Quizzes 
section must contain a list of quizzes that exist in the system and detailed collective 
statistics about student performance must be provided for each quiz.
The system starts with one common login page, and based on who logs in, displays 
appropriate navigation options
